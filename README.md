Second Chance Kitchen is an app that was created to help feed people not landfills 
by recovering prepared but not served food from various vendors and providers.

These meals are from conferences, events, restaurants, and food vendors.

The vendors will sign-in and complete the online form with the meals they have available. 
An email will be generated to each client from the database.

When food is claimed the offering will be removed from available to already claimed.

If food is not claimed within two hours the offering will be removed from the listing.
